# Stacks Interoperability Protocol (SIP)

A decentralized cross-chain communication protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security for trustless interoperability between blockchains.

## Overview

SIP enables seamless asset transfers and message passing between Stacks and other blockchains through a combination of light client implementations, cryptographic verification, and secure bridge contracts.

### Key Features

- **Trustless Verification**: Light clients verify transactions without centralized intermediaries
- **Cross-Chain Asset Transfers**: Bridge assets between Stacks and other blockchains
- **General Message Passing**: Enable smart contract interactions across chains
- **Security-First Design**: Leverage Bitcoin's security through Stacks' Proof of Transfer
- **Economic Security Model**: Incentivize honest verification and challenge mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

SIP consists of multiple interrelated components:

1. **Registry Contract**: Central registry for cross-chain resources and adapters
<!-- 2. **Message Relay**: Handles cross-chain message passing and verification
3. **Light Clients**: Lightweight blockchain clients for verifying external chain state
4. **Bridge Contracts**: Chain-specific contracts for asset locking/unlocking
5. **Verification System**: Cryptographic proof verification for transaction validation -->

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for Clarity contract development
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ for testing and scripting
- Basic understanding of blockchain interoperability concepts

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/gboigwe/stacks-interoperability-protocol.git
cd stacks-interoperability-protocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
clarinet test
```

### Key Contracts

- `sip-registry.clar`: Central registry for cross-chain resources
<!-- - `message-relay.clar`: Message passing infrastructure
- `light-client.clar`: Base contract for light client implementations
- `bridge-core.clar`: Base contract for bridge functionality
- `verification.clar`: Proof verification logic -->

## Use Cases

- **Cross-Chain DeFi**: Access DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains
- **NFT Bridging**: Transfer NFTs between Stacks and other chains
- **Cross-Chain DAOs**: Enable governance across multiple chains
- **Multi-Chain Applications**: Build applications that utilize features from multiple chains
